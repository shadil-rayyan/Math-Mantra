# Custom Accessibility in zMantra

## What is Accessibility in Android?
Accessibility in Android ensures that apps are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities such as **blindness, low vision, or motor impairments**.  
The most common built-in accessibility service is **TalkBack**, which provides spoken feedback and allows blind users to interact with the device using gestures.

## What is Custom Accessibility?
A **Custom Accessibility Service** is when developers build their own accessibility layer on top of Androidâ€™s APIs to create an interaction style that better fits their app.  
Instead of relying only on TalkBackâ€™s gestures, developers can override or simplify the interaction model.

## Why Custom Accessibility in zMantra?
In TalkBack, every action normally requires **two taps**:
1. **First tap** â†’ Focus/select the item.  
2. **Second tap** â†’ Activate it.  

This ensures blind users donâ€™t accidentally trigger something.  
But in **game modes like Tap Mode**, this would make gameplay **slower and less engaging**.

### Our Custom Accessibility Approach:
- We designed a **custom accessibility service** for zMantra where:  
  - **Single tap** directly triggers the game action.  
  - TalkBack-style spoken feedback is still provided.  
  - This makes the gameplay **faster, more natural, and fun**, while still being accessible.  

---

## Example: Tap Mode
- **With TalkBack ON** â†’ To record an answer, the user needs to tap twice.  
- **With Custom Accessibility ON** â†’ Only one tap is needed to record the answer.  

This customization improves **usability and responsiveness** for blind players while keeping accessibility intact.

## Benefits of Custom Accessibility
- **Simplifies gameplay** â†’ fewer steps, more direct interaction.  
- **Still accessible** â†’ speech output and feedback remain.  
- **Inclusive design** â†’ optimized for blind learners who want speed and efficiency.
