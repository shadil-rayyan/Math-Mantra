# TalkBack

## What is TalkBack?
TalkBack is **Google’s built-in screen reader for Android devices**. It is an **accessibility service** that provides spoken feedback, vibration, and audible cues to help people with **visual impairments** interact with their device without needing to look at the screen.

With TalkBack enabled, users can:
- Hear spoken descriptions of what’s on the screen (apps, text, buttons, icons).
- Get alerts when notifications arrive.
- Navigate apps and interfaces using gestures.
- Type using on-screen keyboards with audio feedback.

## How Do Blind Users Use TalkBack?
Blind or visually impaired users rely on TalkBack to:
- **Explore the screen by touch**: When they move a finger across the screen, TalkBack reads aloud the item under the finger.
- **Perform actions with gestures**: For example:
  - **Single tap** → Focus on an item (TalkBack announces it).
  - **Double tap** → Activate the focused item.
  - **Swipe gestures** → Move to next/previous item, scroll, or open menus.
- **Receive spoken confirmation** when interacting with apps (e.g., "Button, Play", "Message sent").

This interaction model allows non-visual users to fully operate smartphones, access apps, send messages, browse the web, and play accessible games.

## Example
- **Without TalkBack**: A sighted user taps a button once to activate it.  
- **With TalkBack**: A blind user first taps to select the button (TalkBack announces: *“Play button”*), then **double-taps** anywhere on the screen to activate it.

## Why Is TalkBack Important?
- It ensures **digital accessibility** for millions of visually impaired users worldwide.  
- It enables independence in using smartphones.  
- Developers must design apps with accessibility in mind, ensuring proper **labels**, **focus order**, and **gesture support** so that TalkBack users can navigate seamlessly.
