## How to Perform Manual Testing

1. **Understand the Feature**  
   - Review the feature or module you are testing.  
   - Check acceptance criteria and requirements.  

2. **Prepare the Environment**  
   - Install the latest APK build of the project.  
   - Ensure device/emulator matches the required Android version.  
   - Verify any prerequisites (e.g., Excel questions loaded, internet connection, accessibility enabled).  

3. **Execute Test Cases**  
   - Follow the defined **test steps** one by one.  
   - Record whether the outcome matches the **expected results**.  

4. **Log Defects (if any)**  
   - If actual result â‰  expected result, mark the status as **Fail**.  
   - Capture screenshots or videos and link them in the **Defect Artifact URL** column.  
   - Assign a **Defect ID** (to track in issue tracker / GitHub Issues / Jira).
