# üìä ExcelQuestionLoader

The `ExcelQuestionLoader` is a utility object responsible for dynamically generating questions from Excel spreadsheets at runtime. It supports customizable operands, templated questions, and on-the-fly answer evaluation using algebraic expressions.

This powers many game modes, including **Tap**, **Shake**, **Draw**, and **Direction** modes.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Responsibilities

- Load and parse `.xlsx` files from `assets/questions/`.
- Filter questions based on:
  - Game mode (`tap`, `shake`, `drawing`, `direction`, etc.)
  - Difficulty level (`1`, `2`, `3`...)
- Replace operand variables in question templates.
- Evaluate mathematical expressions using `exp4j`.

## üß© Excel Sheet Format

| Column Index | Field             | Description                                     |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 0            | Template          | Templated question with `{x}` placeholders      |
| 1            | Mode              | Game mode (e.g. tap, shake, drawing)            |
| 2            | Operands          | Operand values, can include `:`, `,`, or `;`    |
| 3            | Difficulty        | Integer from 1‚Äì3                                |
| 4            | Answer Expression | e.g., `{x} + {y}` (evaluated with `exp4j`)      |
| 5            | Time Limit        | Time in seconds                                 |

## üî¢ Operand Syntax Reference

- `3,5,8` ‚Üí Pick random from list
- `10:15` ‚Üí Random int in range (inclusive)
- `3;4` ‚Üí Multiply: `3 * 4 = 12`
- `A3*B2*` ‚Üí Variable extraction pattern

---

## üß† How It Works

```kotlin
val questions = ExcelQuestionLoader.loadQuestionsFromExcel(
    context, lang = "en", mode = "tap", difficulty = "2"
)
````

### üì¶ Internals

| Function                   | Purpose                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loadQuestionsFromExcel()` | Main entry. Reads `.xlsx` file from assets and returns a filtered list.    |
| `loadQuestionsFromSheet()` | Filters rows by mode and difficulty, processes each into a `GameQuestion`. |
| `extractVariables()`       | Detects `{x}`, `{y}`, etc. used in operand fields.                         |
| `parseInputRange()`        | Converts operand syntax (`:`, `,`, `;`) into concrete values.              |
| `replaceVariables()`       | Replaces `{x}` with generated values in the template and answer formula.   |
| `evaluateEquation()`       | Uses `exp4j` to compute the correct answer if required.                    |

---

## üß™ Example

| Field    | Value              |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Template | What is {x} + {y}? |
| Operands | 1:5*6:9*           |
| Answer   | {x} + {y}          |

‚úÖ Output:

* `x = 3`, `y = 7`
* Rendered Q: `What is 3 + 7?`
* Answer: `10`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Used In

* `BaseGameFragment` (question loading)
* Splash Screen (preload & cache)
* Any game mode that depends on dynamic Excel-driven question generation

---

## üìö Related Files

* `BaseGameFragment.kt`
* `GameQuestion.kt`
* `questions/en.xlsx`
* `libs/exp4j`

---

## üßº Notes

* All parsing is done safely with `try/catch`, so malformed rows are ignored.
* Randomized values make question generation feel varied even with static templates.
* Can be extended in the future to support image-based or audio-based Excel rows.
