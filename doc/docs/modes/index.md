## Tips for Developers
- Each mode is implemented as a `Fragment` extending [`BaseGameFragment`](../architecture/base-game-fragment.md).  
- **Mode name strings** must match the fragment‚Äôs `getModeName()` implementation.  
- Question sets are stored in `assets/questions/{lang}.xlsx` and tied to specific modes.
