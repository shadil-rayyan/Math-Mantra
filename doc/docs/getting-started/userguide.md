- **Top-left**: Back button  
- **Top-right**: Hint button  
- **Drawing mode only**:  
  - Just above bottom-left: Reset button  
  - Just above bottom-right: Submit button  
- The rest of the screen is for drawing input  

In drawing mode, TalkBack is still available if you swipe near the bottom area of the screen.
