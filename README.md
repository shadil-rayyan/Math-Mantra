## 🎯 Overview

**z.Mantra** is a fun, inclusive math learning app for Android, thoughtfully designed for both **visually impaired** and **sighted learners**. The app combines **audio-based guidance**, **gesture-based interaction**, and **playful math challenges** to make math education engaging and barrier-free.

> **Built with love using Kotlin, accessibility-first design, and real-world pedagogy.**

## 📚 Background & Contributions

There was a lack of **fully accessible math learning apps** for Android that truly catered to the needs of **visually impaired learners**. Many existing apps either lacked TalkBack support or failed to offer inclusive interaction models.

To address this gap, z.Mantra was developed by taking inspiration from the **GSoC 2024 Math Mantra project**, especially for features like:

* 🔔 **Bell Ring Mode**
* 🥁 **Drum Mode**
* 📈 **Number Line Mode**

While these served as initial references, the majority of the app—including the **architecture, UX flows, and implementation**—has been **rewritten in Kotlin** and **refactored** for modern standards. Major additions and improvements include:

* 🚀 **New Modes**: Quick Play, Learning Mode, and Game Mode
* 🎛️ **Customizable Settings** for accessibility and experience
* 🧩 **Expanded Gameplay Logic**, accessibility services, and hints system

z.Mantra is now a **standalone, robust, and modern educational game** built from the ground up with inclusivity as its core.
