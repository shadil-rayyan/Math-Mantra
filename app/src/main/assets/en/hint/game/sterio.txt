How to Play the Stereo Number Game (For Blind or Visually Impaired Players)
Welcome to the Stereo Number Game! This game helps you practice subtraction using special stereo audio cues and speech. Here’s how to play:

Objective of the Game
You will hear two numbers spoken through stereo audio: one number in the left ear and another in the right ear. Your task is to subtract the second number from the first and enter the correct answer.

Game Setup
When a new question starts, you will hear the first number played in the left ear and the second number in the right ear.

Between these audio cues, the app will say “minus” to indicate subtraction.

Gameplay Instructions
Listening to the Question:

Press the Read Question button to hear the numbers and the subtraction instruction.

Make sure your headphones are connected for the stereo effect.

If headphones are not connected, the question will be read aloud in a simple sentence.

Answering the Question:

Enter your answer in the answer input field.

Press the Submit Answer button or use the keyboard’s action button to submit your answer.

Tips for Playing
Use headphones: For the best experience, wear stereo headphones to hear the numbers clearly in left and right ears.

Listen carefully: The first number will come in the left ear, then the word “minus,” then the second number in the right ear.

Take your time: Replay the question anytime by pressing the Read Question button.

Check your answer: Make sure to enter a number before submitting.

Accessibility Features

A new question will be generated automatically after a short delay.
