How to Play:
Welcome to the day guessing game!
Here, you will hear a day of the week, like Monday or Friday, and a number telling you how many days to count forward.
Your job is to figure out which day comes after adding those days.
For example, if today is Monday and you add 5 days, what day will it be? You get to choose by tapping one of the big day buttons you hear around you.
Don’t worry if you make a mistake — you get three chances to try again! If you need help, just listen closely to the friendly voice that guides you through the game.
Every time you answer correctly, you’ll get a new question to solve.
Try your best to answer as many questions as you can and watch yourself become a day master! Have fun, keep guessing, and enjoy learning the days of the week in a super fun way!
