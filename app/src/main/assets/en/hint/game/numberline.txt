How to Play the Number Line Game (For Blind or Visually Impaired Players)
Welcome to the Number Line Game! This game helps you practice addition and subtraction by moving along a number line using simple voice commands and button controls. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide to help you play:

Objective of the Game
Your goal is to start at a certain position on an imaginary number line and move either left (subtract) or right (add) by a certain number of units to reach the correct final position.

Game Setup
Starting the Game:

When the game starts, you will hear a spoken question telling you your current position and how many units you need to move, either left or right on the number line.

For example, you might hear: "You are standing on 3. What is 3 plus 4?" or "You are standing on 7. What is 7 minus 2?"

Gameplay Instructions

The question always tells you your current position and whether to add or subtract a certain number.

"Plus" means move right on the number line, and "minus" means move left.

Moving Along the Number Line:

Use the Right button to move one unit to the right (add 1).

Use the Left button to move one unit to the left (subtract 1).

Each button press will move your position by one unit and update your location on the number line.
