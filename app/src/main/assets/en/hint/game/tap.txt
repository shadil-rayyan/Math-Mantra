This game challenges you to tap the screen a specific number of times as indicated by a simple math expression. You’ll receive spoken instructions and audio feedback throughout.

🎯 Objective of the Game
You will be given a math expression such as 2 + 1. Your goal is to tap the screen exactly 3 times.

🕹️ Gameplay Instructions

Each tap is counted.

After each tap, you will hear the current tap count announced.

🎯 Reaching the Target

If correct, you will hear positive feedback.

If you tap more than the required number, it will be considered a wrong attempt.
