<h2 id="welcome">Welcome to zMantra</h2>
<p>zMantra is a math learning app designed especially for visually impaired and blind learners. It uses spoken instructions, interactive input, and fun activities to make learning math easy and enjoyable.</p>
<p>Each screen includes spoken instructions and a Hint button located at the top-right corner. Tapping the Hint button opens a help page with detailed guidance on how to play that activity.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility and Interaction</h2>
<p>When you open zMantra with TalkBack enabled, you will be asked to install and enable a custom accessibility service. This enhances gameplay in modes like tap, drawing, and touch.</p>
<p>In some game areas, TalkBack may not speak directly. However, the layout remains consistent and simple to remember:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Top-left: Back button</li>
    <li>Top-right: Hint button</li>
    <li>In drawing mode only:
        <ul>
            <li>Just above bottom-left: Reset button</li>
            <li>Just above bottom-right: Submit button</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The rest of the screen is for drawing input</li>
</ul>
<p>In drawing mode, TalkBack is still available if you swipe near the bottom area of the screen.</p>

<h2 id="menu">Main Menu</h2>
