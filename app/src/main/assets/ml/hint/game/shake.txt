🤲 How to Play the Shake Game (For Blind or Visually Impaired Users)
This game tests your ability to shake your device a specified number of times as fast as possible while listening to voice instructions and receiving feedback.

🎯 Objective of the Game
You will be asked to shake your device a certain number of times based on a math expression. For example, if the expression is 2 + 1, you need to shake the device 3 times.

🕹️ Gameplay Instructions
🔈 Listening to Instructions
When the game starts, you will hear the math expression read aloud as a shaking target, for example:

“Shake two plus one times.”

This means you must shake the device exactly 3 times.

🤲 How to Shake
Hold your device firmly.

Shake it back and forth or up and down gently.

Each shake counts as one.

You will hear the current shake count announced as you shake.

🎯 Reaching the Target
Once you reach the required number of shakes, the game will evaluate your performance.

If successful, you will hear positive feedback.

If you miss the target or take too long, you may be prompted to try again.

🔄 Retry and Progression
If you don’t reach the correct number of shakes within the time limit, the game will offer a chance to retry.

After 3 failed attempts, the game will end and show your score.

After a successful attempt, the game moves to the next math expression.

⏰ Time Limits and Scoring
Each shake task has a time limit (typically around 20 seconds).

The faster and more accurate you are, the better your score.
