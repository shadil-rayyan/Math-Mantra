    This is the angle game page. Swipe twice to see which angle you need to turn. The text-to-speech will speak the current angle you are at based on your facing direction when the mode starts. The starting direction is considered zero degrees. Turning to the right goes from 0 to 45 degrees, and turning left goes from 360 to 275 degrees. Stay within the correct angle for 3 seconds to win the game.
